    h2 FISH FISHER CLASSES FEATURE
    div.remark
    p.
        The Fisher Classes feature allows you to assign fishers to different classes,
        each with a different fish value. This enables study of inequality, resource
        distribution, and how participants respond to asymmetric payoffs.
    h4 How it works
    p.
        When enabled, fishers are divided into two classes: an "advantaged" class and
        a "disadvantaged" class. Each class has its own fish value, so the same catch
        yields different profits depending on which class a fisher belongs to.
    h4 The Profit Gap column
    p.
        When fisher classes are enabled, a "Profit Gap" column can be displayed in the
        game table. This shows each fisher the difference between their actual earnings
        and what they would have earned if they had the other class's fish value.
        Positive values (shown in blue) indicate the fisher is earning more than they
        would in the other class; negative values (shown in red) indicate they are
        earning less.
